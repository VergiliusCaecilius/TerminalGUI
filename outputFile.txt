     The ttoouucchh utility sets the modification and access times of files.  If
     any file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.

     By default, ttoouucchh changes both modification and access times.  The --aa and
     --mm flags may be used to select the access time or the modification time
     individually.  Selecting both is equivalent to the default.  By default,
     the timestamps are set to the current time.  The --dd and --tt flags
     explicitly specify a different time, and the --rr flag specifies to set the
     times those of the specified file.  The --AA flag adjusts the values by a
     specified amount.

     The following options are available:

     --AA      Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by
             the specified value.  This flag is intended for use in modifying
             files with incorrectly set time stamps.

             The argument is of the form "[-][[hh]mm]SS" where each pair of
             letters represents the following:

                   _-       Make the adjustment negative: the new time stamp is
                           set to be before the old one.
                   _h_h      The number of hours, from 00 to 99.
                   _m_m      The number of minutes, from 00 to 59.
                   _S_S      The number of seconds, from 00 to 59.

             The --AA flag implies the --cc flag: if any file specified does not
             exist, it will be silently ignored.

     --aa      Change the access time of the file.  The modification time of the
             file is not changed unless the --mm flag is also specified.

     --cc      Do not create the file if it does not exist.  The ttoouucchh utility
             does not treat this as an error.  No error messages are displayed
             and the exit value is not affected.

     --dd      Change the access and modification times to the specified date
             time instead of the current time of day.  The argument is of the
             form "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]" where the letters represent
             the following:
                   _Y_Y_Y_Y    At least four decimal digits representing the year.
                   _M_M, _D_D, _h_h, _m_m, _S_S
                           As with --tt time.
                   _T       The letter T or a space is the time designator.
                   _._f_r_a_c   An optional fraction, consisting of a period or a
                           comma followed by one or more digits.  The number
                           of significant digits depends on the kernel
                           configuration and the filesystem, and may be zero.
                   _t_z      An optional letter Z indicating the time is in UTC.
                           Otherwise, the time is assumed to be in local time.
                           Local time is affected by the value of the TZ
                           environment variable.

     --hh      If the file is a symbolic link, change the times of the link
             itself rather than the file that the link points to.  Note that
             --hh implies --cc and thus will not create any new files.

     --mm      Change the modification time of the file.  The access time of the
             file is not changed unless the --aa flag is also specified.

     --rr      Use the access and modifications times from the specified file
             instead of the current time of day.

     --tt      Change the access and modification times to the specified time
             instead of the current time of day.  The argument is of the form
             "[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]" where each pair of letters represents the
             following:

                   _C_C      The first two digits of the year (the century).
                   _Y_Y      The second two digits of the year.  If "YY" is
                           specified, but "CC" is not, a value for "YY"
                           between 69 and 99 results in a "CC" value of 19.
                           Otherwise, a "CC" value of 20 is used.
                   _M_M      The month of the year, from 01 to 12.
                   _D_D      the day of the month, from 01 to 31.
                   _h_h      The hour of the day, from 00 to 23.
                   _m_m      The minute of the hour, from 00 to 59.
                   _S_S      The second of the minute, from 00 to 60.

             If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values
             default to the current year.  If the "SS" letter pair is not
             specified, the value defaults to 0.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ttoouucchh utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The obsolescent form of ttoouucchh, where a time format is specified as the
     first argument, is supported.  When no --rr or --tt option is specified,
     there are at least two arguments, and the first argument is a string of
     digits either eight or ten characters in length, the first argument is
     interpreted as a time specification of the form "MMDDhhmm[YY]".

     The "MM", "DD", "hh" and "mm" letter pairs are treated as their
     counterparts specified to the --tt option.  If the "YY" letter pair is in
     the range 39 to 99, the year is set to 1939 to 1999, otherwise, the year
     is set in the 21st century.

     The ttoouucchh utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2
     ("POSIX.2") specification.

       _P_i_c_o is a simple, display-oriented text editor based on the Alpine
       message system composer.  As with Alpine, commands are displayed at the
       bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.  As
       characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text.

       Editing commands are entered using control-key combinations.  As a
       work-around for communications programs that swallow certain control
       characters, you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice,
       followed by the desired control character, e.g. "ESC ESC c" would be
       equivalent to entering a ctrl-c.  The editor has five basic features:
       paragraph justification, searching, block cut/paste, a spelling
       checker, and a file browser.

       Paragraph justification (or filling) takes place in the paragraph that
       contains the cursor, or, if the cursor is between lines, in the
       paragraph immediately below.  Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines,
       or by lines beginning with a space or tab.  Unjustification can be done
       immediately after justification using the control-U key combination.

       String searches are not sensitive to case.  A search begins at the
       current cursor position and wraps around the end of the text.  The most
       recent search string is offered as the default in subsequent searches.

       Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted with creative use of the
       command for mark (ctrl-^), delete (ctrl-k) and undelete (ctrl-u).  The
       delete command will remove text between the "mark" and the current
       cursor position, and place it in the "cut" buffer.  The undelete
       command effects a "paste" at the current cursor position.

       The spell checker examines all words in the text.  It then offers, in
       turn, each misspelled word for correction while highlighting it in the
       text.  Spell checking can be cancelled at any time.  Alternatively,
       _p_i_c_o will substitute for the default spell checking routine a routine
       defined by the SPELL environment variable.  The replacement routine
       should read standard input and write standard output.

       The file browser is offered as an option in the "Read File" and "Write
       Out" command prompts.  It is intended to help in searching for specific
       files and navigating directory hierarchies.  Filenames with sizes and
       names of directories in the current working directory are presented for
       selection.  The current working directory is displayed on the top line
       of the display while the list of available commands takes up the bottom
       two.  Several basic file manipulation functions are supported:  file
       renaming, copying, and deletion.

       More specific help is available in _p_i_c_o's online help.

OOppttiioonnss
       ++_n     Causes _p_i_c_o to be started with the cursor located _n lines into
              the file. (Note: no space between "+" sign and number)

       --aa     Display all files including those beginning with a period (.).

       --bb     Enable word wrap.

       --dd     Rebind the "delete" key so the character the cursor is on is
              rubbed out rather than the character to its left.

       --ee     Enable file name completion.

       --ff     Use function keys for commands.  This option supported only in
              conjunction with UW Enhanced NCSA telnet.

       --hh     List valid command line options.

       --jj     Enable "Goto" command in the file browser.  This enables the
              command to permit explicitly telling _p_i_l_o_t which directory to
              visit.

       --gg     Enable "Show Cursor" mode in file browser.  Cause cursor to be
              positioned before the current selection rather than placed at
              the lower left of the display.

       --kk     Causes "Cut Text" command to remove characters from the cursor
              position to the end of the line rather than remove the entire
              line.

       --mm     Enable mouse functionality.  This only works when _p_i_c_o is run
              from within an X Window System "xterm" window.

       --nn_n    The -n_n option enables new mail notification.  The _n argument is
              optional, and specifies how often, in seconds, your mailbox is
              checked for new mail.  For example, -n60 causes _p_i_c_o to check
              for new mail once every minute.  The default interval is 180
              seconds, while the minimum allowed is 30. (Note: no space
              between "n" and the number)

       --oo _d_i_r Sets operating directory.  Only files within this directory are
              accessible.  Likewise, the file browser is limited to the
              specified directory subtree.

       --rr_n    Sets column used to limit the "Justify" command's right margin

       --ss _s_p_e_l_l_e_r
              Specify an alternate program _s_p_e_l_l to use when spell checking.

       --tt     Enable "tool" mode.  Intended for when _p_i_c_o is used as the
              editor within other tools (e.g., Elm, Pnews).  _P_i_c_o will not
              prompt for save on exit, and will not rename the buffer during
              the "Write Out" command.

       --vv     View the file only, disallowing any editing.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print Pico version and exit.

       --ww     Disable word wrap (thus allow editing of long lines).

       --xx     Disable keymenu at the bottom of the screen.

       --zz     Enable ^Z suspension of _p_i_c_o.

       --pp     Preserve the "start" and "stop" characters, typically Ctrl-Q and
              Ctrl-S, which are sometimes used in communications paths to
              control data flow between devices that operate at different
              speeds.

       --QQ _q_u_o_t_e_s_t_r
              Set the quote string.  Especially useful when composing email,
              setting this allows the quote string to be checked for when
              Justifying paragraphs.  A common quote string is "> ".

       --WW _w_o_r_d___s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r_s
              If characters listed here appear in the middle of a word
              surrounded by alphanumeric characters that word is split into
              two words. This is used by the Forward and Backward word
              commands and by the spell checker.

       --qq     Termcap or terminfo definition for input escape sequences are
              used in preference to sequences defined by default.  This option
              is only available if _p_i_c_o was compiled with the TERMCAP_WINS
              define turned on.

       --sseettllooccaallee__ccttyyppee
              Do setlocale(LC_CTYPE) if available. Default is to not do this
              setlocale.

       --nnoo__sseettllooccaallee__ccoollllaattee
              Do not do setlocale(LC_COLLATE). Default is to do this
              setlocale.

       Lastly, when a running _p_i_c_o is disconnected (i.e., receives a SIGHUP),
       _p_i_c_o will save the current work if needed before exiting.  Work is
       saved under the current filename with ".save" appended.  If the current
       work is unnamed, it is saved under the filename "pico.save".

CCoolloorr SSuuppppoorrtt
       If your terminal supports colors, Pico can be configured to color text.
       Users can configure the color of the text, the text in the key menu,
       the titlebar, messages and prompt in the status line. As an added
       feature Pico can also be used to configure the color of up to three
       different levels of quoted text, and the signature of an email message.
       This is useful when Pico is used as a tool (with the -t command line
       switch.)

       Pico can tell you the number of colors that your terminal supports,
       when started with the switch -color_codes. In addition Pico will print
       a table showing the numerical code of every color supported in that
       terminal. In order to configure colors, one must use these numerical
       codes. For example, 0 is for black, so in order to configure a black
       color, one must use its code, the number 0.

       In order to activate colors, one must use the option -ncolors with a
       numerical value indicating the number of colors that your terminal
       supports, for example, _-_n_c_o_l_o_r_s _2_5_6 indicates that the user wishes to
       use a table of 256 colors.

       All options that control color, are four letter options. Their last two
       letters are either "fc" or "bc", indicating _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d _c_o_l_o_r and
       _b_a_c_g_r_o_u_n_d _c_o_l_o_r, respectively. The first two letters indicate the type
       of text that is being configured, for example "nt" stands for _n_o_r_m_a_l
       _t_e_x_t, so that -ntfc represents the color of the normal text, while
       -ntbc represents the color of the background of normal text. Here is a
       complete list of the color options supported by Pico.

       --ccoolloorr__ccooddee
              displays the number of colors supported by the terminal, and a
              table showing the association of colors and numerical codes

       --nnccoolloorrss _n_u_m_b_e_r
              activates color support in Pico, and tells Pico how many colors
              to use.  Depending on your terminal _n_u_m_b_e_r could be 8, 16, or
              256.

       --nnttffcc _n_u_m

       The manner in which lines longer than the display width are dealt is
       not immediately obvious.  Lines that continue beyond the edge of the
       display are indicated by a '$' character at the end of the line.  Long
       lines are scrolled horizontally as the cursor moves through them.
